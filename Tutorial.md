Epicinium is a multiplayer strategy game with simultaneous turns.
Each turn consists of a planning phase, where all players decide which orders they want to give their units that turn,
followed by an action phase, where players watch as the the orders play out.
Each player has limited vision and only sees *how* an opponent's units act, not *why*.

*The red player has just ordered his rifleman unit to move through a neutral city and up to the city owned by the blue player.*

You can give up to five new orders each planning phase.
If a unit does not complete their order during the action phase, it will continue executing that order in following action phases until it does,
or until it is given a new order.
Review your orders in the order list (shown bottom right) before pressing the ready button (top right) to proceed to the action phase.

## Tiles

City tiles can be ordered to construct other buildings or produce units.
Select a tile and right-click it to access these abilities.
When a tile produces a unit, the size of the unit depends on the tile's *power*, which is the number of powered buildings it has.
Buildings can gain power and generate income at night.

Tiles depend on their environment in order to gain power; cities thrive when surrounded by grass and forest, whereas industry and barracks tiles require nearby cities.
Using a tile to construct another tile or produce a unit reduces its power.

## Units

Units such as riflemen can be ordered to move across the map and fight other units.
Units have limited movement speed but will continue moving in following turns.
Ground units will automatically attack enemy units in their path.

Rifleman units can capture enemy cities.
Other units such as tanks offer more destructive capabilities.
Access these abilities by right-clicking a unit while it is selected.

## How to win

Defeat opponents by capturing or destoying all of their cities.

Each tile has a temperature and an air humidity that determine its weather.
Weather changes with the seasons and affects unit speed and survivability.
Extreme weather can even destroy trees and buildings and turn lush grasslands into deserts.
This not only impedes the growth of nearby cities,
but also negatively affects your score if you win the game.

Global warming increases the longer a game lasts, causing chaotic weather conditions.
Certain actions, such as building industry or bombarding forest tiles, contribute to global warming.
You can limit your contribution by depending less on industry, but will your opponent play as cautiously?
