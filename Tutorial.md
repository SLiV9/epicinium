Epicinium is a multiplayer strategy game with simultaneous turns.
Each turn consists of a planning phase, where all players decide which orders they want to give their units that turn,
followed by an action phase, where players watch as the the orders play out.
Each player has limited vision and only sees *how* an opponent's units act, not *why*.

*The red player has just ordered his Rifleman unit to move through a neutral Town and into the City owned by the blue player.*

You can give up to five new orders each planning phase.
If a unit does not complete their order during the action phase, it will continue executing that order in following action phases until it does,
or until it is given a new order.
Review your orders in the order list (shown bottom right) before pressing the ready button (top right) to proceed to the action phase.

## Tiles

City tiles can produce units and construct other buildings.
Select a tile and right-click it to access these abilities.
When a tile produces a unit, the size of the unit depends on the tile's *power*, which is the number of powered buildings it has.
Using a tile to produce a unit or construct another tile reduces its power.

At night, buildings can gain power and generate income.
Tiles require a suitable environment in order to gain power; City and Town tiles thrive when surrounded by Grass and Forest tiles, whereas Industry and Barracks tiles grow when you build City tiles nearby.

## Units

Units such as riflemen can move across the map and fight other units.
Units have limited movement speed but will continue moving in following turns.
Ground units will automatically attack enemy units in their path
and fire back if attacked.

![A Rifleman unit captures a City tile. A Tank unit shells a City tile.](https://i.imgur.com/BeXw1yv.gif "A Rifleman unit captures a City tile. A Tank unit shells a City tile.")

Rifleman units can capture enemy cities,
whereas other units such as Tanks offer more destructive capabilities.
Access these abilities by right-clicking a unit while it is selected.

## Environment

Each tile has a temperature and an air humidity that change with the seasons.
Crops only grow in suitable conditions and weather effects can reduce unit speed and survivability.
Global warming worsens over time and ramps up when players build more industry,
leading to chaotic weather conditions
that can destroy buildings and turn lush grasslands into deserts.

![A Sapper unit destroys the last enemy City tile. All the Grass and Forest tiles are scored.](https://i.imgur.com/ATKFHkM.gif "A Sapper unit destroys the last enemy City tile. All the Grass and Forest tiles are scored.")

Defeat opponents by capturing or destoying all of their City tiles.
Environmental destruction not only impedes the growth of your cities and crops,
but also negatively affects your score if you win the game:
at the end of the game, the winner earns 1 point for each Grass and Forest tile left on the map.
