# Epicinium

Epicinium is a turn-based strategy game with environmental gameplay mechanics.

During the day, players give orders and watch their units execute them.
At night, cities grow depending on the number of grasslands and forests surrounding them.
Building industry provides more income and allows for the production of tanks,
but industry rapidly increases global warming to ludicrous levels.
At the end of the game, the winner is scored for whatever's left of the world at that point.
