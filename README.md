# Epicinium

Epicinium is a turn-based strategy game with environmental gameplay mechanics.

During the day, players give orders and watch their units execute them.
At night, cities grow depending on the number of grasslands and forests surrounding them.
Building industry provides more income and allows for the production of tanks,
but industry rapidly increases global warming to ludicrous levels.
At the end of the game, the winner is scored for whatever's left of the world at that point.

Epicinium is being developed for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

After you play a few games of Epicinium, please let us know what you think using our [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/dBinPxt1hR2tnufq1).

Since the game is still in development, bugs or outright crashes may occur. If you find any bugs while playing, please [email us](epiciniumgame@gmail.com) with a short description of what happened; if you could attach the contents of the logs folder and the recordings folder, that would be especially helpful.
