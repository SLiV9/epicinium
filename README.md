## Epicinium

This repository contains documentation files for Epicinium and includes a [wiki](https://github.com/SLiV9/epicinium/wiki) explaining the game's mechanics.
The tutorials are no longer up to date but the wiki is accurate.

Epicinium is a strategy game where nature is a finite resource, available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
Is it worth winning a war when you end up conquering nothing but dirt and ash?

Epicinium is handcrafted to bring you a fresh strategic experience.
Thanks to fast, simultaneous turns, you don't waste time waiting for your move.
Your economy and troops are influenced by the environment and increasingly severe weather effects.
Players balance firepower and preservation of resources, as the victor is scored for how much nature remains when the dust settles. 

Epicinium was released on October 12th, 2020 as a free game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286730/Epicinium/) and [itch.io](https://abunchofhacks.itch.io/epicinium).
